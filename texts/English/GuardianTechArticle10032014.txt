Don\'t mistake Apple\'s silence for imminent collapse Putting hopes for Apple\u2019s future on a magical \u2018New Category\u2019 misunderstands its real direction \u2013 its Ecosystem Game. Many wrongly interpret this as a company in death throes apple tv A screen shot showing the OS update menu for the new Apple TV is pictured as Craig Federighi, Apple Senior Vice President, Software Engineering, discusses the Mountain Lion OS during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference 2012 in San Francisco, California. \u201CThe iPhone is seven years old. The iPad was introduced four years ago. Since then\u2026 nothing. Apple\u2019s growth is gone: a mere 9% revenue uptick in 2013; only 6% for the last quarter. \u201CIt\u2019s time to acknowledge the painfully obvious truth: Innovation has deserted Apple. Something must have gone seriously wrong if the company can no longer break into new categories.\u201D This refrain echoes through the web\u2026 and is the toxic waste of success. It started back in the early 1980s when all we wanted was a better Apple ][ (or a working Apple \/\/\/)\u2026 and we were stunned by the Macintosh. We were unable to imagine a mouse + a bitmapped display + moveable windows + pull-down menus, all the things that came to define the next iteration of personal computers. We couldn\u2019t imagine it because we didn\u2019t have the right words to think with. The Mac created a template for what we\u2019ve come to expect from Apple: a breakthrough. Now we\u2019ve had two epochal hits in rapid succession \u2014 the iPhone and iPad \u2014 and, once again, we\u2019re hooked. We need another fix, another burst of excitement, something New and Different. We\u2019re no longer satisfied with the boring New and Improved. The desire for Something New is understandable, but breakthroughs don\u2019t happen on demand. And a \u201Cbreakthrough\u201D isn\u2019t always necessary. PC evolution Consider the PC. In rough numbers, the PC is 40 years old. In that time, it has matured into what we now enjoy through gradual improvements to hardware and software: Better graphics, sound, displays, user interface, network connectivity. Why don\u2019t we take as much pleasure in the continuous flow of improvements to our smartphones and tablets? When we regard the new categories that Apple has \u201Cfailed\u201D to create (or join) we face a number of problems. We\u2019ll make short work of the fantasised Apple TV set. We all know what we want: \u00E0 la carte content served to us as apps through an Apple-grade device. We\u2019ve had enough in the US of the Soviet-era set-top boxes and tiered pricing foisted on us by cable companies. Even if Apple wanted to head in that direction \u2014 and step into the quagmire of exploitative relationships between content creators, distributors, and de facto carrier monopolies \u2014 the impact on the company\u2019s top and bottom lines, revenue and profit, would be moderate. Ten million set-top boxes at (say) $299 makes \u201Conly\u201D $3bn \u2014 that\u2019s less than 2% of last year\u2019s revenue. (A short digression on the curse of large numbers: At Apple\u2019s size, which is approaching $200bn in yearly revenue, a \u201Cbreakthrough\u201D product would need to generate at least 5% \u2014 $10bn \u2014 in order to move the needle. That\u2019s approximately one Facebook of revenue.) What about wearables? It\u2019s a lively category and will get livelier as sensors get more sophisticated, consume less energy, and benefit from software refinements. Microsoft had one years ago; Pebble, Samsung, and many others offer \u201Csmartwatches\u201D; Fitbit and Jawbone Up manufacture \u201Cfitness bracelets\u201D. My take on smartwatches and bracelets (the next Apple TV: iWatch, more iWatch fun and Apple\u2019s wearable future) is that Apple is already in that category \u2013 with the \u201CAlways With Us\u201D iPhone and motion sensing, and with apps such as Azumio\u2019s Instant Heart Rate app. Long road to new profit? We now turn to cars. The CarPlay announcement at the Geneva Motor Show follows the iOS in the Car presentation at 2013\u2019s WWDC (Apple\u2019s Developers Conference). We have to ask: How does the CarPlay money pump work, and in which direction? Does Mercedes pay Apple, or the other way around? On the technical and user interface (UI) levels, how does the tightly controlled and consistent Apple experience survive the wide range of UI cultures and cost constraints so painfully obvious in today\u2019s cars? On its CarPlay webpage, Apple makes broad promises: To activate Siri voice control, just press and hold the voice control button on the steering wheel. If your CarPlay-equipped vehicle has a touchscreen, you can use it to control CarPlay. and.. CarPlay also works with the knobs, dials, or buttons in the car. If it controls your screen, it controls CarPlay. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how \u201Cthe apps you want to use in the car have been reimagined\u201D and how automakers play one smartphone ecosystem against another. In any case, CarPlay isn\u2019t a product that\u2019s meant to stand on its own. In Apple\u2019s own words, it\u2019s part of the iPhone ecosystem: CarPlay is a smarter, safer way to use your iPhone in the car. CarPlay takes the things you want to do with your iPhone while driving and puts them right on your car\u2019s built-in display. A not-so-surprising pattern emerges: Rather than play the New Category game, Apple stays the Ecosystem Development course it\u2019s been on since the advent of the truly epoch-making iTunes. Tim Cook may claim of the $99 Apple TV black puck that \u201Cit\u2019s a little bit harder to call it a hobby\u201D, but its yearly revenue is in the $1bn range, less than 1% of the company\u2019s overall number. Apple may make a wearable someday, but will everyone want an iWatch the way they want an iPhone? And let\u2019s not expect direct revenue upticks from CarPlay; just a more pleasant iPhone experience in \u201Cselected\u201D vehicles. This gets us to Apple\u2019s deeply rooted fixation: From its 1 April 1976 founding to this day, Apple has been in one and only one business: personal computers. Today, they come in three sizes: Macs, iPads, and iPhones. Everything else Apple creates \u2014 iTunes, the App Store, the physical Apple Stores, Apple TV pucks, CarPlay, the mythical iWatch \u2014 these are all part of the supporting cast, and they have a single mission: prop up the volume and margins of the star products. This isn\u2019t to diminish the importance of the supporting cast. iTunes begat the iPod, a product once so successful it generated more revenue than the Mac in 2006. iTunes also introduced the distribution mechanism and micropayment system that unleashed the iPhone\u2019s full power, making it an \u201Capp-phone\u201D. As our friend Horace Dediu points out, the iTunes Music and App Stores by themselves would rank No.130 in the Fortune 500 list (yearly gross revenue of $23.5bn, +34% growth in 2103). Nonetheless, the iTunes Store doesn\u2019t have a separate P&L (profit & loss) statement in Apple\u2019s financials because there\u2019s only one P&L figure, for the entire company. There are no \u201Cline of business\u201D numbers because there\u2019s only one business. As the Macalope explains, ecosystems are put to very different uses by Amazon and Google, on the one hand, and Apple: \u201CAmazon and Google sell tablets at cut rates in order to get people to use their ecosystems. It\u2019s less crucial for them that people buy tablets; they just want people to use tablets to buy stuff and look at ads. Apple makes money off its ecosystem, too, but unlike Amazon and Google that\u2019s not where it makes most of its money.\u201D The rising tide of R&D Still, there is another possibility. Apple could get into an entirely new business, as opposed to one or more of the ecosystem-supporting products\/services mentioned above. One such example is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Instead of opening another line of product sales, fresh produce or wine, Amazon got into the business of renting servers to companies large and small. It\u2019s not Amazon\u2019s biggest line, generates less than 3% of total revenue, is thought to be very profitable (unlike the main lines) and grows very fast. Gartner thinks AWS is now larger than its next five competitors combined. An amazing success. Amazon did it because it developed a superior computer services infrastructure for its core business and decided to offer similar services to any and all. Back to Apple. Could one imagine the company using some of its hard-earned expertise to branch into a different, non-personal computers business? For a not-too-serious example, Porsche makes cars and there is a Porsche Design business. But I don\u2019t see Tim Cook telling Sir Jony Ive to open a design studio business. And Porsche Design generates virtually no revenue compared to the Porsche car maker. Such branching out sounds very remote. So is it true that Apple has given up on developing its business? In 2013, Apple increased its R&D spending by 32% (you can read and\/or download Apple\u2019s entire 10-K report); 2012 was +39%. In the previous two fiscal years ending September 2013 \u2014 and without entering any new category \u2014 Apple increased its R&D spending by 83% to $4.5bn, 3% of revenue. And then it increased it by another 33% in the quarter ending December 2013. Accelerated R&D spending can only mean one thing: Apple is widening the range of products under development. Let\u2019s just hope company execs continue to be as good as they\u2019ve been in the past at saying No, at not shipping everything they engineer.
