Park View Educational Trust claimed Ofsted inspectors had gone into schools looking for extremism and religious segregation. David Hughes, vice-chairman of the trust, launched a passionate defence of the school\'s record, saying it was helping children from one of the poorest neighbourhoods in the UK to aspire to a decent future. He claimed the investigations were undermining community cohesion and said the trust would be legally challenging the Ofsted findings.
